# ember-quickstart

This is a very simple Ember app based on the introductory 'Quick Start' lesson.
I've created a list consisting of programmers and scientists.
As time goes on, I'll add additional functionality such as:
- fake data
- list creation
- web scraping from NASA
- web scraping from starred GitHub profiles

* Fork/clone this!
* Visit your scientists at [http://localhost:4200/scientists](http://localhost:4200/scientists).
* Visit your scientists at [http://localhost:4200/programmers](http://localhost:4200/scientists).
